About Dataset

CONTEXT

By taking into account a variety of input data, this kernel aims to estimate the price of a property that a realtor may charge or a consumer would invest to purchase. Additionally, to more effectively categorize the houses into the Good and Excellent categories based on the input characteristics utilizing the best machine learning regression and classification methods.

Inspiration

I was inspired by the House sales dataset in Brazil from Worldquant University where I found that House prices can fluctuate based on the market and a variety of criteria such as location, living area, number of bedrooms, year built, and so on. All of these elements contribute to determining the house's sale price and rating. Millions of housing records can be saved, together with all the data and elements in historical timelines. We can use machine learning techniques to evaluate data and anticipate the price of new houses, as well as classify properties and set a pricing value by considering all of the aspects that have an influence on the entire selling of a property.
